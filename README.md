Fake News Detection System	Ádám Kiss	Attila Matyi

PROJECT OVERVIEW
PROBLEM 
OR ISSUE 	The rise of misinformation and fake news on digital platforms affects public opinion, decision-making, and trust in media. There is a growing need for automated solutions to detect and mitigate fake news effectively.
PURPOSE OF PROJECT	This project aims to develop a machine-learning-based system to classify news articles as real or fake. The system will help users identify unreliable information and promote factual reporting.
BUSINESS CASE	With the increasing spread of disinformation, businesses, social media platforms, and fact-checking organizations require tools to assess news credibility. Our Fake News Detection model will provide an automated, scalable, and efficient way to verify news content.
GOALS / METRICS	The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between real and fake news articles. Success will be measured by achieving at least 85% accuracy in classification. The evaluation will be based on key performance indicators such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Additionally, the project aims to implement a web-based interface where users can input news articles for verification, ensuring the model’s usability in real-world scenarios.
EXPECTED DELIVERABLES	The project will result in a fully developed data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline to handle raw news data efficiently. A trained machine learning model for fake news detection will be created and optimized for performance. Furthermore, a user-friendly web application will be developed to allow users to verify news articles in real-time. The project will be documented in a final report detailing methodologies, findings, and potential improvements, which will be presented as part of the course requirements.
